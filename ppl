In aviation, PPL stands for Private Pilot License.
A Private Pilot License (PPL) is a type of aviation certification that allows an individual to fly aircraft for personal or recreational purposes, 
but not for commercial use (i.e., not for compensation or hire). It is one of the most common types of pilot licenses and is the foundational certification for 
anyone looking to pursue a career in aviation or fly as a hobby.
